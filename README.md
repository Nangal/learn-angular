Collection of work from Udemy's Angular 4 - The complete guide by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller

> Master Angular (both Angular 4 and Angular 2) and build awesome, reactive web apps with the successor of Angular.js

## Course Content

1. **Getting Started (aa)**
 - create and serve a new project:

         ng new aa-get-start
         cd aa-get-start
         ng serve --open

 - install bootstrap under apps->styles in '.angular-cli.json' file, path to bootstrap.min.css file is relative to /src/index.html, note that bootstrap must be included in the cli file prior to starting the server, changes to this file are not dynamically updated

         npm install --save bootstrap
         npm install --save font-awesome // (optional)

2. **The Basics (ab)**
 - create a new component called server, a new directory under the app folder (not using cli tool)
 - model the same files found under the app folder using a similar naming convention for ts, html, and css files
 - modules are used to bundle components
 - new server module is added to `app.module` file under the declarations property
 - include your new components onto the page with custom selectors that follow the naming convention similar to `app-<component name>`
 - self-review assignment:
    - create a new angular app using the cli
    - load Bootstrap CSS framework via npm and load into the app
    - create a new server component and load onto the page
 - use the ng cli tool to create components automatically:

         ng generate component <name of component>

 - components can be nested and combined in any combination
 - `template` or `templateUrl` must be present in the `@Component({})` decorator object, use the inline template property for convenience if the html code is not long
 - `styles` or `styleUrl` is optional and only affects the specific component, use the inline styles template for convenience if the css code is not long
 - there are three options when creating component selectors in the html code, *element selectors* are most common:

         selector: 'app-servers'   // by element   <app-servers>             </app-servers>
         selector: '[app-servers]' // by attribute <div app-servers>         </div>
         selector: '.app-servers'  // by class     <div class='app-servers'> </div>

 - What is databinding? Databinding = Communication between your business logic and the html template
 - Four types of **Databinding**
    - Output Data (one-way data binding)
      - Interpolation `{{ data }}`
      - Property Binding `[property]="data"`
      - `data` is a property or method() in the app.component.ts namespace
      - In most cases, either technique can be used to achieve the same result, it would be wise to develop a convention on when one technique should be used over the other for consistency
    - Input Data - react to user events (one-way data binding)
      - Event Binding `(event)="method()"`
      - Event Binding `(event)="method($event)"`
      - `(event)` refers to a specific event defined by the html specification. `input`, `click`, and `keypress` are common events, see the [MDN event reference for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
      - `$event` is an object that contains information about the html element associated with the `(event)`
    - Two-way-binding `[(ngModel)]="data"`
      - `FormsModule` must be added to the `imports[]` array in the AppModule
      - `FormsModule` is imported from `@angular/forms`
      - This technique is referred to 'two-way-binding' because it essentially combines property and event binding, the data model is automatically updated based on user-driven events like typing text into an input field
  - Introduction to **Directives** - "directives give instructions to the DOM"
    - Built-in structural directives, `*ngIf` and `<ng-template>` (if-else template), uses * to denote it is a structural binding
      - if - `<p *ngIf="business-logic"></p>` where `business-logic` is code that evals to a boolean
      - if-else - `<p *ngIf="business-logic; else somethingElse"></p>` where somethingElse is marked with # inside a ng-template selector, for example `<ng-template #somethingElse></ng-template>`
      - *IMPORTANT DISTINCTION* - structural directives completely add or remove selectors from the DOM, they are not just simply made invisible
    - Built-in attribute directives, `[ngStyle]`, uses square brackets [ ] similar to property binding notation
      - `[ngStyle]="{'background-color': getColor()}"`, notice the method call getColor() is not wrapped in quotes
      - `[ngClass]="{'class-name': <boolean>}"`, the CSS class-name will be attached to the selector if `<boolean>` code evaluates to true
      - *IMPORTANT DISTINCTION* - attribute directives do not remove selectors from the DOM, only their attributes are changed
    - Built-in structural directive, `*ngFor`

          <app-server *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>

      - use the reserved word `index` to gain access to the iteration number:

            <app-server *ngFor="let server of servers; let i = index"></app-server>

3. **Course Project - The Basics**
  - The course project is revisited several times during this course, therefore, only one project directory will be used with sections identified through version control
  - A new TypeScript feature introduced wherein a shortcut can be used to define a class.  In the traditional sense, a class is defined as follows:

         export class MyClass {
             public name: string;
             public quantity: number;

             constructor(name: string, quantity: number) {
                 this.name = name;
                 this.quantity = quantity;
             }
         }

  - The same class can be succinctly defined as:

         export class MyClass{
             constructor(public name: string, public quantity: number) {}
         }

  - An important topic that will be addressed in future versions of the class project include learning how components can exchange data with each other.

4. **Debugging (ad)**
  - Using the 'Sources' tab in Chrome Dev Tools, breakpoints can be set allowing you to  step through your code
  - In the dev stage, Sourcemaps are provided under the webpack section, your TypeScript code can be found in its original form under the '.' folder
